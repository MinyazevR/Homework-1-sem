Night and silence given for ages
Rain or maybe it is snowing
Anyway I am warmed up with an endless hope
I see a city far away which does not exist
 
There where it is easy to find a shelter for a stranger
Where for sure they remember you and wait for you
Day by day losing or confusing a trace
I go to this city which does not exist
 
There a hearth is burning for me
Like an eternal sign of forgotten truth
There is the last step till it
And this step is longer than the life
 
Who will answer me what is given by destiny
Let it be not fated to know about it
Perhaps behind a threshold of the waisted years
I will find this city which does not exist
 
There a hearth is burning for me
Like an eternal sign of forgotten truth
There is the last step till it
And this step is longer than the life
 
There a hearth is burning for me
Like an eternal sign of forgotten truth
There is the last step till it
And this step is longer than the life
